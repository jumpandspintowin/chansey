# Chansey is a library on top of {http://rubyeventmachine.com EventMachine} to
# provide a modular engine for events and handlers. A module can both generate
# events and receive them. A router provides pub-sub functionality between the
# two, allowing multiple modules to receive events. The original idea for
# Chansey is to provide an easy, extensible framework for implementing an
# internet services bot. The framework makes it simple to interconnect clients
# for Twitter, IRC, Facebook, E-Mail, RSS, and anything else to handlers that
# can perform any action on events.
